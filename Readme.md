## My process

Initially, I started creating desktop screen, I created one box where all of elements was included. I added main image, heading, paragraph, also i used 2 span tag in order to my page shoud had good design, and the end of box i added image and name of author.I styled this page according to figma. When i finished working on html, i started working on css, I used different mean to this page make preetier, finally i added media query for mobile screen and changed some properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first approach

### What I learned

First of all i learn how to use flexbox, this is very useful thing in order to make our design responsive and page have preety layout. second it was using of hover, in general using of hover very easy but in this case the element should affect other element, it was most difficult in project for me i had no idea how to solved this challange, finally I solved this problem.
